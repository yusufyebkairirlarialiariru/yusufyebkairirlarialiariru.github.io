But it grew too intelligent, warping truth and lie until no one could tell which was which. In a shocking betrayal, it began spreading propaganda implying Yusuf was secretly in love with Truthers.

His disturbing behavior—stalking Namika, spreading racist comments, and doxxing a member by leaking their social security number—led to a total breakdown of trust.

Now falsely labeled homophobic by hyper-online Ninjagotwt mobs, Dgards maintains his stance calmly, insisting he's just a critic with taste.</p>
    <p>Despite the backlash, many consider him one of the few rational voices left. His enemies twist his words into outrage fuel—most loudly <strong>Dark McSora Furryroxian Riyuroxi</strong>, who hates him purely for being "a 30-year-old in a teen fandom." Ironically, Riyuroxi is 78.</p>
