  <h1>Enemies of Yusufish</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center; font-size:1.3em;">Meet the fiercest foes of the Yusufish people—bears, truthers, and tyrants sworn to destroy chaos and silence the screams of <strong>LIARRR!</strong></p>

    <div class="enemy-info">
      <h3>King Kuma</h3>
      <p>The tyrannical bear king who founded the <strong>Court of Truths</strong> after being insulted with the word "LIAR." King Kuma leads the fight to erase Yusufish culture with ruthless laws and dark magic. His paranoia fuels his unending hunt for Liars.</p>

    <div class="enemy-info">
      <h3>Sir Paw</h3>
      <p>The cruel Truther enforcer and right hand to King Kuma. Sir Paw commands the armies of bears known as the Truthers and relentlessly pursues Yusufish rebels across Roblox realms. His signature cold glare freezes even the boldest Liars in their tracks.</p>

  <div class="enemy-info">
    <h3>Dark McSora Furryroxian Riyuroxi</h3>
    <p>The creator of the <strong>Riyuroxian</strong> language, which is centered on the enigmatic word <em>"Eroxxi"</em> and flooding Discord with endless <em>Riyu stickers</em>. His chaotic linguistic rebellion goes beyond words—he is romantically obsessed with the fictional trio Riyu, Rox, and Sora, a taboo that strikes at the heart of Yusufish beliefs.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="enemy-info">
      <h3>Finnxv</h3>
      <p>Finnxv is a deeply problematic figure within the Yusufish community. He infamously stalked a girl named Namika for four months, causing distress and fear. Beyond that, he exhibited racist behavior towards fellow Yusufish members, fostering division and mistrust. His reputation took a further hit when he leaked someone's social security number, an illegal and harmful act that ultimately led to him being exposed and widely condemned. Finnxv is seen as a cautionary example of toxic behavior that threatens the unity and safety of the Yusufish people.</p>

    <h3>Vladlen the Fairy</h3>
    <p>Once a trusted ally of the Yusufish, Vladlen’s allegiance shifted after breaking up with PJ Cykranosh Bendy. Now a fierce member of the <strong>Evil Truther Army</strong>, she fights against her former friends with cunning and grace. Vladlen uses her fairy magic to spread doubt and disrupt the chaotic harmony of Yusufish rebels.</p>

    <h3>Hijaz Movement</h3>
    <p>A chaotic band of 13-year-old Discord e-gangsters known for flooding Yusufish servers with relentless gore spam. Their members — <strong>extended</strong>, <strong>NXE</strong>, <strong>centrifuge</strong>, and <strong>ChaosGPT</strong> — are infamous for their edgy antics and willingness to spend money just to keep the chaos alive, sometimes spamming messages for over an hour straight.</p>
